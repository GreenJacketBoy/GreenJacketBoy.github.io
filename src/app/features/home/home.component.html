                <p>Oh hi ! Welcome to the home page of my website !</p>
                <p>I did debate with myself for quite some time on whether this should be the "Home" or "Hub" page, which would functionally be the same, so I guess I can always change it later. </p>
                <p>We really need to invent new words. </p>

                <p>Anyways, ... Oh right, my name ! My legal name is Yann, although I find it doesn't sound amazing in an english sentence, and my online name attached to my real life identity is Green Jacket Boy, or Green for short.</p>
                <p>As an alternative you can call me Glenn, it's a good balance between my legal and online name, and it doesn't sound strange in an english sentence. I also happen to really like this name.</p>

                  <p>If you wish to contact me, you can do so by sending me an email at <b>greenjacketboy&#64;proton.me</b>, or by writing me a message on <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/green-jacket/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a></b>.</p>
                  <p>It's worth noting that this is not <i>really</i> my professional email. Just like my phone number I would prefer not to have it publicly on the internet. Of course it doesn't mean that you can't contact me for professional reasons through this email. </p>
